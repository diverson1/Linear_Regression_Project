Hello, This was a basic python project completed at the end of my python fundamentals
 course. I used it as an oppurtunity to get comfortable conducting version controls utilizing the command line.
My goals were:
* Create README file from command line
* Create a repo clone on both my mac and windows to work from
* Get comfortable utilizing the command line to navigate to my local repo
* Utilize the command line to commit and push changes to github
* Create a seperate brach from main to conduct the project 
* Merge secondary branch with main upon completion of project
